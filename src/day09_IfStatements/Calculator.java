/*
  Task:
  2. Create a class called Calculator, Given two double variables named n1 & n2, and a char variable named mathOperator,
     write a program that can calculate result of n1&n2 based on the given math Operator.

		char operator -> -, +, *, /

		when operator is + : add num1, num2
		when operator: - : minus num1, num2
		when operator: * : multiply num1, num2
		when operator: / : divide num1, num2
		for any other operators: print "invalid operator"

		Ex:
			n1 = 10, n2= 20, mathOperator = '+'

		output:
			30
