    Day 01 Notes Introduction To Java

    (1) - What is Java?                     -> A Programming Language. Others: Python, Csharp, C++, Ruby...
                                               (each of the programming languages has different syntax).
                                            -> Computer language used to develop Software Programs or Applications.
                                            -> Most used programming language in the world.
                                               (More than 3 billion devices running on Java)
                                            -> Primary Language used in IT Companies

    (2) - Where is Java mostly used at?     -> Software Development, Web Development, Android Games, App Development...

    (3) - History Of Java                   -> Released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems.
                                            -> Initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton in 1991.
                                            -> Originally named Oak, then Green, and released as Java.
                                            -> Sun Microsystems was purchased by Oracle Corporation in 2010.

   (4) - Components in Java                 -> JVM: Java virtual Machine (3) (Responsible for running the byte codes
                                                                              that are translated by Java Compiler)

                                            -> JRE: Java Runtime Environment (4) (Java Class Library contains all the
                                                                                  resources that are needed to write the
                                                                                  source code)
                                            -> JDK: Java Development Kit (1) (Contains the tools and resources that are
                                                                             needed in order to write a source code and
                                                                             execute a source code)

                                            -> Javac: Java Compiler (2) (Responsible for translating the source codes
                                                                        to the byte codes which is a language that the
                                                                        computer can understand)


   (5) - How Java Works?                    -> 1. Source code   (Sends to)      --->  Java Compiler
                                               2. Java Compiler (Translates to) --->  BYTE CODE (Its numbers)
                                               3. BYTE CODE     (Goes to)       --->  JVM (runs the byte code)
                                               4. JVM           (Delivers)      --->  Final Output (What is seen on the
                                                                                                    computer screen)

   (6) - IDES for Java                     -> Integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that
                                              provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software
                                              development.
                                              - IntelliJ IDEA     - eclipse     - NetBeans     - Visual Studio
                                              - Visual Studio Code

   (7) - Why IntelliJ                     -> Started at around 25% in 2012 ---> Latest in 2019 it's around 63%
                                             (Been in the market for more than 25 years)
