            Notes about main() method

     * First is the Class Header   Example: public class HelloWorld{

     * Opening Curly brace must be at the end of the Class Header and closing curly braces at the end of code

     * Every Java application must contain a main method.

     * Opening Curly brace must be at the end of the Class Header and closing curly braces at the end of code but before
       Class header closing curly brace.

     * When the Java interpreter executes an application, it starts by calling the class's main method.

                  public static void main(String[] args){} (main method)

     * Short cut to type main method. main + enter = public static void main(String[] args){}

     * In order to print any messages on the console, must have a print statement.

                  System.out.println();  (Print statement without message)

                  System.out.println("Hello World");  (Print statement with message)

     * Semicolon must be at the end of every statement.

     * Short cute to type a print statement. sout + enter = System.out.println();
